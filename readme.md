# BasilPress - A GeneratePress Child Theme
BasilPress is the starter theme used for all of our projects

## Basic info
* It relies on `Sauce Library` for complete functionality
* It integrates well with `Page Builder by SiteOrigin` and `SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle`, as they are part of our basic WordPress package

## Features
* GeneratePress enhancements:
  * `Fixed Header`: it's possible to set a fixed positioned header via Customizer options
  * `Advanced Menu`: it's possible to define you primary menu content via a Layout Builder widget
* PageBuilder by SiteOrigin enhancements:
  * In `Padding Mode` each row has a top and bottom padding, instead of a bottom margin applied
  * In `Standard Mode` you can set a *panel margin divider* value so that a smaller margin will be applied to widgets within a row
